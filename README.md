# Hoaxford

## About the Project
This project was made as a requirement for our **Data Science (CS 132)** course at the University of the Philippines Diliman. *Hoaxford* delves into disinformation surrounding Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s academic accomplishments. Our goal was to determine whether the filing of his certificate of candidacy had to do with the influx of tweets defending his credentials. And so, using correlational analysis, we did just that.

## Our Poster (Info Dump)

## Conclusion
Based on the results of our project, we concluded that **there was a significant increase in the number of tweets defending BBM's false credentials after the filing of his certificate of candidacy**. Thus, our findings provide insights into the tactics used by disinformation campaigns. Furthermore, we hope that insights like these can **help design countermeasures to protect truth and justice from those who would weaponize ignorance**.
